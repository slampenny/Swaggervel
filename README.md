# Swagger 2

This branch uses Swagger-spec 2.0 and Swagger-php 2.0. 
This branch also updates the Swagger-ui to version 2.1.1.

# OAuth2

The Swagger-ui was changed to allow inserting the OAuth 2 parameters (``client_id``, ``client_secret``, ``realm`` and ``appName``) directly in the ui.
You can also pass these values in the url in the URL, like so:
``http://api.appcursos.com/api-docs?client_id=my-client-id&client_secret=my-client-secret&realm=my-realm&appName=my-app-name``

To use Swaggervel for Laravel 4.2, use the version 1.0 branch (https://github.com/slampenny/Swaggervel/tree/1.0)

# Swaggervel

Swagger for Laravel

This package combines [Swagger-php](https://github.com/zircote/swagger-php) and [swagger-ui](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-ui) into one Laravel-friendly package.

When you run your app in debug mode, Swaggervel will scan your app folder (or any folder that is set under the "app-dir" variable in the packages config), generate swagger json files and deposit them to the doc-dir folder (default is `/docs`). Files are then served by swagger-ui under the api-docs director.

### Installation


- Add `Jlapp\Swaggervel\SwaggervelServiceProvider` to your providers array in `app/config/app.php` above your route provider, to avoid any catch-all routes
- Run `php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Jlapp\Swaggervel\SwaggervelServiceProvider"` to push swagger-ui to your public folder.

### Example


- www.example.com/docs  <- swagger JSON files are visible
- www.example.com/api-docs <- swagger ui is visible.

### Options


Uncomment the "viewHeaders" option in the Config file to add headers to your view.

### How to Use Swagger-php


The actual Swagger spec is beyond the scope of this package. All Swaggervel does is package up swagger-php and swagger-ui in a Laravel-friendly fashion, and tries to make it easy to serve. For info on how to use swagger-php [look here](http://zircote.com/swagger-php/). For good examples of swagger-php in action [look here](https://github.com/zircote/swagger-php/tree/master/Examples/Petstore).
